# Deploying-LSTM-based-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Streamlit

## The code was ran on Apple M1 Macbook Air that uses Tensorflow plugin for metal acceleration

This is a basic demonstration of how to deploy a deep learning model using streamlit on local server.</br>
I have used LSTM as my language model and a dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data</br>

`streamit run lstm.py`
